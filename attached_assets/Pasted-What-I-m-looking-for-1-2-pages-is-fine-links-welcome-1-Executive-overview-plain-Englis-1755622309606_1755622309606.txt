What I’m looking for (1–2 pages is fine, links welcome):

 

1. Executive overview (plain English)

 

* What the app does today and who uses it

* The current state (what’s working, what’s WIP, any known issues)

* Immediate priorities for the next 30–60 days

 

2. Tech summary (for developers)

 

* Tech stack and key libraries (frontend, backend, DB, real-time, validation, routing, state)

  *(From your doc, I understand it’s React + TypeScript (Vite), Express + TypeScript, Postgres with Drizzle, WebSockets, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, React Query, Wouter, RHF + Zod.)*&#x20;

* How to run locally (clone, install, scripts), required environment variables, and secrets handling

* Repo location/branches and any CI/CD details

* Database details (where it lives, migrations/Drizzle workflow, seed data, backups)

 

3. Deployment & maintenance

 

* Where it’s hosted right now (I know you used Replit during development) and any gotchas

* How deployments are done today and a suggested “good” path (e.g., Vercel/Render/Fly + managed Postgres)

* Monitoring/logging/error reporting (what exists vs. what’s needed)

* Weekly maintenance tasks a consultant should own (dependency updates, DB backups, uptime checks, etc.)

 

4. Security & access

 

* Auth model (roles, password hashing, session/JWT approach), password reset flow, and any open security to-dos

* Access and handoff list: repo, DB (staging/prod), environment files, API keys—please note what exists and what we still need to set up

 

5. Features with tricky logic (so a new dev doesn’t break them)

 

* Budget import (Excel), unit conversions, validations, and where files are stored

* Task linking/ordering, weekday/weekend rules, and real-time updates behavior

* Any concurrency/conflict resolution patterns we rely on

 

6. Roadmap / future expansion ideas (tie to business goals)

 

* Daily labor review and printed schedules; budget vs. actual reporting; role-based dashboards

* Integrations we care about (Sage Intacct for timesheets, Samsara GPS, Outlook/Teams for distribution)

* RFI helper / AI workflows; audit logs; mobile/offline; ADA checks and standard plan helpers

 

7. “Consultant brief” (copy I can paste into a job post)

 

* Commitment: 5–20 hours/week depending on needs

* Work directly with me (company President; I’m not technical)

* Must learn our business flow, constraints, and goals; communicate clearly in plain English

* Initial deliverables for the first 2–4 weeks (your suggestion) and ongoing cadence (weekly check-ins, docs expectations)

 

Open questions / clarifications I’d love you to cover

 

* Hosting & links: Replit project link(s), current deployment URL (if any), and your recommendation for production hosting

* Environment: full .env variable list with descriptions; how secrets are currently stored

* Database: current Postgres provider, credentials handoff plan, migration/backup process, and seed/demo data

* Auth: confirm password hashing and reset flows; any libraries in use; known gaps

* Excel import: sample file + field mapping; size limits; library used; where uploads live

* Testing/tooling: current test coverage, lint/format setup, and code style notes

* API docs: Postman/Insomnia collection or endpoint notes beyond the PDF

* Known bugs/tech debt: top 5 issues and your recommended order of attack
